# Music App

This is a Music application that allows the users to upload custom songs with their custom song names and artist names.

This application has two separate folders.
[Server](server) and [Client](client).

The server side has been written in Python. The API allows us to interact between our database and UI.

The DBMS used in this project is PostgreSQL and Cloudinary (for storing the media files)
