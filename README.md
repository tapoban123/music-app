# Music App using Flutter and Python

This is a Music application that allows the users to upload custom songs with their custom song names and artist names.

This application has two separate folders.
[Server](server) and [Client](client).

The server-side has been written in [**Python Programming Language**](https://www.python.org) and the client-side has been written in [**Dart Programming Language**](https://dart.dev) using the [**Flutter Framework**](https://flutter.dev).

The back-end allows us to interact with the PostgreSQL database from the application UI. We have used the [FastAPI framwork](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) of Python to build the back-end.

The DBMS used in this project is [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) (for storing the media files)
